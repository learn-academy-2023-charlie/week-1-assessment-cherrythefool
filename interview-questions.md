<!-- # ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software. It makes it possible to make changes to a software while tracking those changes. Git is the software and github is a website which uses that software for shared, remotely-hosted version control.

Researched answer: Git is a local version control software, meaning it's software on a device and tracks changes made to a software. GitHub uses git as part of a remotely-located repository. The benefits of using github are that it is free and open to the public, making software changes easier to share

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the location assignment while the value is the information stored in the array. So if you stored the colors of the rainbow in order in an array, red would be a value and stored at the index of 0, and violet would be a value stored at the index location of 6.

Researched answer: item =value

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are both data types in javascript. An array contains an ordered group of items of varying values, and can contain values of multiple data types as a collection. A string is also ordered, but contains multiple characters rather than items. While a string can contain any character, the characters will all be part of the data type of string. Both arrays and strings are indexed and can be manipulated into different orders.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming involves 2 people working on the same code, using the roles of driver and navigator. The person who is navigating should be thinking through how to write the code and instructing their partner on what to type and any necessary changes, while the driver should be typing the code. While they may work together on problem solving, only one person (the driver) should be working in the file at a time.
