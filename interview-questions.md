<!-- # ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software. It makes it possible to make changes to a software while tracking those changes. Git is the software and github is a website which uses that software for shared, remotely-hosted version control.

Researched answer: Git is a local version control software, meaning it's software on a device and tracks changes made to a software. GitHub uses git as part of a remotely-located repository. The benefits of using github are that it is free and open to the public, making software changes easier to share 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: JavaScript operators that are relational or equals operators, like , will return a Boolean value.

Researched answer: JavaScript comparison operators, like equality, relational, and logical operators, can return a Boolean value.  

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the location assignment while the value is the information of the item stored in the array. So if you stored the colors of the rainbow in order in an array, red would be a value and stored at the index of 0, and violet would be a value stored at the index location of 6.

Researched answer: In an array, each piece of data stored within the array is called a "value". The location each value is stored at is assigned a number, and this is called the index. The index starts at 0 for the first value and increases from there, so the second value is indexed at 1 and so on.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are both data types in javascript. An array contains an ordered group of items of varying values, and can contain values of multiple data types as a collection. A string is also ordered, but contains multiple characters rather than items. While a string can contain any character, the characters will all be part of the data type of string. Both arrays and strings are indexed and can be manipulated into different orders.

Researched answer:
Strings and arrays have some similarities; they are both ordered and indexed, and methods can be applied to alter or manipulate the data within them. 
They also have important differences. An array must be stored as a variable; a string can be if needed but it is not necessary. An array is stored in [square brackets] while a string is wrapped in "quotation marks". Finally, an array contains different values of any data type, while a string typically contains  only characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming involves 2 people working on the same code, using the roles of driver and navigator. The person who is navigating should be thinking through how to write the code and instructing their partner on what to type and any necessary changes, while the driver should be typing the code. While they may work together on problem solving, only one person (the driver) should be working in the file at a time. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a powerful tool when used well, and can improve solutions, increase efficiency, and create better understanding. To best use this tool, two programmers work together as a driver and navigator. The driver follows instructions and types, and is the only one working in the file. The navigator gives instructions and dictates code, and should not be working in the file. This autonomous pair is most successful when working for less than half an hour in each role and taking breaks as needed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: The main feature distinguishing higher-order functions (HOFs) from other functions is that HOFS take a function as their argument. HOFs are typically made for arrays and work through each value in an array. 

2. Jest: Jest is a way to test JavaScript code to uncover errors and failures, as well as their causes. 

3. Objects: Objects are a data type in JavaScript. They are collections of values paired to keys. The values can be any data type while the keys are symbols. The values can be accessed using dot notation with the key.

4. Method: A method is an object with behavior. Objects can store any kind of datatype as a value, and functions are one of those possibilities for values. Functions stored in this way are called methods.

5. Classes: A class is a specific type of function that serves as a sort of template or guide with objects.
